# Tanks 4 Godot

This is my first little attempt at building a game with Godot. 

I am using the Godot Top-down Tank Battle tutorial series by KidsCanCode
as a starting poing for my own game. I am using this tutorial series to 
get a hang of the basics of Godot. 

Of course, I have my own ideas of how I want my game to be, so it will
evetually diverge from the KidsCanCode game. But for now, I'm figuring
things out by following along.
